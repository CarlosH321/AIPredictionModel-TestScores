Can a computer predict test scores, study time, and sleep. In this project I made, I trained a simple AI model using Python and real data.

My project works by having a DataChart with info such as sleep, score, hours studied. The AI uses this info to find the prediction on a test score.

The following tools I used for this project was the following Thonny with some downloads in Thonny like pandas and scikit-learning built inside Thonny. Also used Python which was on Thonny. Last I used a GoogleSheet to make my data I gave to the AI such as Hours_Studied, Hours_Slept, Test_Score.

My results that came out were pretty good for what I seem to be showing a good percentage, such as shown here "The AI predicted a test score of 78.77534027830583 for a student who studied 6 hours and slept 8 hours." stated by the AI.

A new skill I learned from this project was using data in my work and inputting it into my AI with Python.
